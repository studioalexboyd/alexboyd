## Alex Boyd - Artist / Historian / Writer

I am a Scottish artist writer, historian, artist and photographer based in Western Australia. I am currently completing a PhD on Scotland's Military Landcapes, with particular emphasis on Northern Scotland. Working with the Ministry of Defence, this thesis examines the role of the military in environmental conservation of their sites, as well as public perceptions of restricted land. 

The exhibition 'Tir an Airm', a photographic exploration of military land in Scotland, was presented at Stills - Scotland's Centre for Photography in 2021.
